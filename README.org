Ever tried to edit an Org source block with no mode defined, and then got surprised Emacs didn't have a nil-mode? Well, then consider this package, as it adds what you may want: absolutely nothing!

Just kidding. This package just defines a major mode derived from ~fundamental-mode~ called ~nil-mode~, so you can open your source blocks just fine.
